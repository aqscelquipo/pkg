SARscape is a software module that integrates with ENVI, a powerful image analysis and visualization tool. SARscape allows you to process and analyze synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from various sensors and platforms. With SARscape, you can perform tasks such as geocoding, interferometry, polarimetry, change detection, and classification.

ENVI 5 is the latest version of ENVI that offers a modern user interface, enhanced performance, and new features. One of the new features is the ENVI Modeler, a visual programming tool that lets you create custom workflows in ENVI without any coding. You can use the ENVI Modeler to automate and batch-process SAR data using SARscape.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use SARscape for ENVI 5 to process SAR data in a few simple steps. We will use an example dataset of Sentinel-1 images over Mount Etna, Italy.
 
1. Launch ENVI 5 and open the SARscape Analytics tool from the Toolbox.
2. Select the SAR Data Processing workflow from the list of available workflows.
3. Choose the input data type (in this case, Sentinel-1) and browse to the folder where the data files are stored.
4. Select the output folder where the processed data will be saved.
5. Choose the processing options that you want to apply to the data. For example, you can select geocoding, calibration, speckle filtering, multilooking, and terrain correction.
6. Click Run to start the processing. You can monitor the progress and status of the processing in the Console window.
7. When the processing is finished, you can view the results in the Data Manager and display them in the Image window. You can also export them to other formats or use them for further analysis.

SARscape for ENVI 5 is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that enables you to process and analyze SAR data with minimal effort. You can learn more about SARscape and ENVI 5 by visiting their official websites[^1^] [^2^] or by contacting their support team.
  
In this section, we will show you how to use SARscape for ENVI 5 to perform interferometric analysis on the processed SAR data. Interferometry is a technique that uses the phase difference between two or more SAR images to measure surface deformation, elevation, or vegetation height.

1. Open the SARscape Analytics tool again and select the Interferometric Processing workflow from the list of available workflows.
2. Choose the input data type (in this case, Sentinel-1) and browse to the folder where the processed data files are stored.
3. Select the output folder where the interferometric data will be saved.
4. Choose the interferometric options that you want to apply to the data. For example, you can select coregistration, interferogram generation, phase unwrapping, and geocoding.
5. Click Run to start the interferometric processing. You can monitor the progress and status of the processing in the Console window.
6. When the processing is finished, you can view the results in the Data Manager and display them in the Image window. You can also export them to other formats or use them for further analysis.

SARscape for ENVI 5 allows you to perform interferometric analysis on SAR data with ease and accuracy. You can use interferometry to monitor surface changes such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, landslides, or subsidence. You can also use it to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) or canopy height models (CHMs).
